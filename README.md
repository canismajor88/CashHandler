# CashHandler

## Cash Handler API

The custom-built API handles all the business logic for the application. We followed the model view controller (MVC) design pattern where our view will be our Angular app, and our controllers and models are held in our API. The API will be a layer of abstraction which will facilitate interactions between the user interface and the database. It will also require authentication for access to the database, and will validate inputs where necessary. The API also consumes Microsoft's Entity Framework Core. This abstracts the communication between the API and the database in order to build our endpoints in a more efficient and safe manner.

## Cash Handler UI

The user interface will be used as the bridge between the user and the api. The user interface is built with angular 13 and bootstrap 5.0 to provide a responsive and intuitive foundation upon which users can access the app from both a desktop or mobile device.

--CALEB ADD THE PUBLIC REPO SO ALL THE SECRETS ARE OUT PARTS

Please contact Caleb (cvgq6b@mail.umkc.edu) if you are trying to build and run API and Angular app locally. We are using azure to host our database and will have to let you IP be registered with our firewall for data access
